<h2>THE MAN IN THE MOON.</h2>


<div class='cap'>ONCE upon a time, long before people were able to
learn what they wanted to know from printed
books, long before children had pretty pictures to tell
them tales, there lived an old student with his pupil.
Together they spent all the day in poring over musty
old books and papers, trying to find out why the sun
was hot; and in the night-time they might always be
seen gazing at the sky, counting how many stars there
were there. They were very curious folk, and wanted to
know the reasons for all sorts of out-of-the-way things
that everybody else was content to know the mere facts
of, such as why birds have two wings and not three,
why crocodiles have no fins, seeing that they can swim
in the water, and many other matters that would not
interest sensible beings. They always had at their side a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
young owl, and a serpent, toothless and blind with age;
for they thought that youthful observation and aged
craftiness were most suitable companions for them in their
labours. If at any time old Fusticus, for so the old
student was named, got dispirited in his work, or felt
inclined to give it up as a hopeless task, he had but to
turn round in his chair, and there behind him sat his
owl, who seemed to say, as he cocked his head on one
side, "Never despair, success only comes after long perseverance!"
Or if he stuck fast at any point, and
could make no progress, one glance at the old serpent
made him think, "Snakes wait whole days and nights
on watch for their prey; why should I give in?" And,
strange to say, with a little more attention and care, he
always did get over his smaller difficulties.</div>

<p>But at last old Fusticus got weary of his long studies,
as he seemed never to find an answer to any one of the
questions he had set himself; and he was about to
give them up altogether, when he came across a curious
passage in the old tome in which he was reading. For
a long time he could not make it out at all, but after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
deep thought and consultation with his pupil, he discovered
that it was a spell, by which he could call up
the Spirit of Darkness, whom he could compel to grant
him any three wishes that he might demand. The only
condition was that he should give to the Spirit of
Darkness whatever he should ask of him.</p>

<p>Old Fusticus thought and thought a long time over
this discovery, and at last decided to make use of it.
So one day he repeated the charm he had learnt from
the book, and when he had finished the last word, to
his amazement, for he did not quite believe it was all
true, there stood before him the Spirit of Darkness!
He was not at all like what he had imagined he would
have been; for he had not a hideous face, nor a tail,
but was dressed in the costume of a court gentleman,
with a sword at his side and a cocked hat in his hand.
He had, too, a pigtail, ruffles and all complete!</p>

<p>"Sire," he said to Fusticus, "what is your will?
You have summoned me to you by a power not your
own&mdash;you know the condition on which you use that
power. What is your wish?"</p><hr class="chap" /><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>"My wish you shall soon learn, or rather my three
wishes. But what is it that you demand in return?"</p>

<p>"All that I ask is now&mdash;nothing! All that I want
is your first-born babe!"</p>

<p>"I have no child&mdash;I am an old man without a wife.
If I had a child, you should have him." Fusticus did
not think what he was saying, you see; but he felt
quite safe in offering a thing that did not exist.</p>

<p>"'Tis a bargain!" cried the wicked Spirit at once and
with glee. "Here is a written compact! Sign!" and
Fusticus with a laugh put his name to the paper, for he
thought: "Ah, my fine fellow! you have over-reached
yourself this time! In trying to get too much, you
have got nothing at all!" and he laughed again.</p>

<p>"Your wishes?" asked the Spirit of Darkness, putting
the signed document into his coat-tail pocket.</p>

<p>"Well!" said Fusticus, "first of all I will have&mdash;&mdash;
dear me! what shall I have? Now I come to think of
it, I don't know that I want anything at all! Let me
see, I have clothes, a house, my owl and my old serpent,
I have a pupil, my books, my&mdash;oh! I know! I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
have not got a horse to ride upon! But to wish for
only a horse! Spirit, let me have a <i>Cock</i> large enough
for me to ride upon!"</p>

<p>And forthwith there appeared a monstrous cock, so
large that Fusticus could easily sit upon its back. And
this he at once did. "Shan't I look grand now!"
thought Fusticus, "as I ride through the village. All
eyes will be upon me!" Just at that moment the cock
gave a loud crow, and began to strut onwards, and away
they went to the village. And as the last sound of the
cock's crow died away, the Spirit of Darkness vanished.</p>

<p>The cock made his way straight to the village, and
through the chief street. Everybody turned to look at
Fusticus and his remarkable mode of travelling, but his
friends did not, as he had expected, seem very much
struck with its grandeur. "Poor old Fusticus has gone
quite mad," they said to each other; "that comes of
too much reading!" and they would not return the
polite bows that Fusticus showered upon them. And so
silly old Fusticus soon came to repent his first wish.
"Oh! that I had not been so foolish!" cried Fusticus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
and as soon as he got out of the village, he dismounted
from his cock, and again called upon the Spirit of
Darkness.</p>

<p>"And so you already want something more? You
mortals are never contented," said the latter. "Everybody
laughs at my steed," answered Fusticus; "I cannot
ride through the streets without looking absurd! Give
me a golden carriage, drawn by four real horses this
time, with as many servants as attend a duke;" and the
next moment up drove the most magnificent carriage he
had ever beheld, with four prancing white horses, and a
footman and two postilions. Behind it rode two lords,
to guard it. "Now I shall indeed be happy! Now my
friends can no longer laugh!" thought Fusticus, and
the very next day he took his first drive.</p>

<p>When his friends saw that Fusticus had come into
such luck, and had such a grand carriage of his
own, they all thought "Dear me! some rich relation of
Fusticus must have died, and left him all this. I hope
he did not see me laugh when he passed me yesterday
on that curious cock of his!" But Fusticus was too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
pleased to be unfriendly with anybody, when he saw
what marked attention his grand equipage brought him.
He sat smiling inside his carriage and had a kind word
for all, even for the poor old woman he saw the
rough villagers jeering at and abusing. He even called
to them to stop breaking the pitchers and pots that
she was trying to sell in the market-place, the only
grudge that they had against her being that she had
a rather more hooked nose than their own!</p>

<p>Fusticus now lived for some time quite happy. Everybody
thought a great deal of him, because of his fine
carriage, in which he used to take daily drives. All the
young unmarried ladies of the village tormented him
that he was still a bachelor, saying that his carriage
must have been made for two, as there were two seats
in it. And this seemed such a forcible argument to
Fusticus, that he soon took one of the ladies as a wife.
In course of time a little baby was born to them.
Scarcely was the child a week old, when one morning,
just as Fusticus was nursing his little pet, in through
the window sprang the Spirit of Darkness! Drawing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
written compact from his pocket, he said, "In accordance
with this, give me up your child, your first-born!
But you have one wish still left. What may it be?"
Fusticus was struck dumb; he could not recover himself
for a long time, for in his happiness he had quite forgotten
his promise, quite forgotten his third wish, and
all about the Spirit of Darkness!</p>

<p>"I cannot yield my child, my young and innocent
darling!" he cried. "Anything else you may take&mdash;my
life, my carriage, anything, but leave me my child!"</p>

<p>"The child! the child! and nothing else!" shrieked
the demon, and then, regaining himself, with a smile
added: "And your last wish?"</p>

<p>"If I lose my boy," answered Fusticus, "my joy
on this earth is for ever gone. If you take my child,
then, oh Spirit of Darkness and Deceit! then, may I for
all eternity pass my life in the Moon!" "Granted too
is your third&mdash;&mdash;" "But I have not finished yet,"
broke in Fusticus, "and may my child for ever remain
with me there!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 445px;">
<img src="images/illus_015.jpg" width="445" height="600" alt="holding child" />
</div>

<p>And there you may see them both to this day, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
the child was changed into a spider. And every now
and then the good little spider lets himself down by his
thread to the earth and takes his father back all the
news of the day.</p>

<p>But if you, Reader, had three wishes granted to
you, I hope you would choose them better and more
wisely than did old Fusticus!</p>

<h2>CAT AND DOG STORIES.</h2>


<div class='cap'>IT was a rainy November afternoon, and floods of
water poured down from the skies, growing hourly
in strength. "Just as if the heaven were weeping to
find that its tears grew so plentiful," I thought. I
know that it is sometimes the case with me. When I
am naughty and am scolded, I begin to cry just a little;
but my tears flow quicker and quicker as I think how
shameful it is for a great girl like me to be weeping,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
and the more ashamed I become, the more I cry. But
I must not go on like this, or my story will turn out
a tearful one, and I shall really end by weeping myself.</div>

<p>Well, it was a rainy day, raining so hard that I
could not go out on the lawn to play; and I was tired
of amusing myself with my soft ball indoors. I was
sitting with my head resting between my hands, trying
to think of some new game, when suddenly the door
swung open, and in walked a crooked old woman,
trudging towards me on her crooked staff.</p>

<p>"Why are you so unhappy, my dear?" she asked me
in a kind, though croaking, voice.</p>

<p>"I don't know how to pass the time, ma'am," I said,
rather frightened.</p>

<p>"Little girls, aye, and big girls too, should always
have something to do; they should never idle away
their hours. I am your fairy godmother, Nelly; look
at my face."</p>

<p>And I looked up at her. Sure enough, she did
look like my godmother, only a little more ugly and
a good deal more kind!</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>"As you have been a good girl this morning, and
finished your knitting and sewing, I am going to give
you something that will amuse you. I am going to
gift you with the knowledge of animal language.
Look at your cat and dog on the hearth! They are
telling each other stories. Would you like to listen to
what they are saying?"</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>that</i> I should!" I exclaimed.</p>

<p>She touched me on the lips with her crooked staff,
and suddenly I heard two little voices gossiping round
the fire. I glanced round at my fairy godmother, but
she had vanished. I had not time to think how wonderful
it all was&mdash;I was too much taken up
with what I heard. There sat my precious
Miss Perkie, with King Charlie at her side,
so interested that his little pink tongue
had pushed its way out through his teeth.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 120px;">
<img src="images/illus_022.png" width="120" height="159" alt="dog with bow" />
<span class="caption">KING CHARLIE.</span>
</div>

<p>I drew my chair nearer to the hearth,
so that I might hear their conversation the better. But
Charlie turned round upon me rather angrily, and said:</p>

<p>"If you want to listen, Nelly, don't make such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
noise with your stool. It disturbs me, and it is really
provoking to lose the thread of an adventure in that
way. Pray begin the story again, Perkie."</p>

<p>He always was rather a sharp-tempered dog, so I did
not answer him. Yet the rude way in which he
addressed me struck me as rather funny. I remember
thinking that, perhaps, if all the world spoke dog-language,
dogs would be the masters, and we human
beings the slaves.</p>

<p>Perkie then continued:</p>

<p>"As I was saying&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, she has put the first part out of my head, now!
If I am once stopped in a story all the first part
vanishes. I never was very quick at learning and all
that, you know. People think that petting and cuddling
are quite enough for a dog of my royal pedigree! They
never consider my mind. It is true I can beg, and play
at hide-and-seek with a biscuit: I can eat game, and
drink real turtle-soup. And they pay great respect to
my dignity and kingly grace; but as for my mental&mdash;however,
never mind that, Pussy; it's not to the point!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Go on with your story from the beginning, and Nelly
and I will listen."</p>

<p>"I was going to tell Charlie of an adventure that
I once had with some horrid, mongrel dogs," said
Pussy. "I hate dogs, and so does my whole race,
and mongrels more than any others. Now a noble
mastiff or a royal King Charles" (and here Miss Perkie
bowed graciously to her companion, though I fancied
I could see a faint little smile curl round her lower
jaw as she glanced up at me, as if to say to me
that she only put up with him for my sake), "neither
of <i>them</i> would worry a harmless cat, for they are real
gentlemen, who honour weakness and timidity" (another
little nod). "But to go on with my story&mdash;</p>

<p>'I was out in the yard one day to see if I could
not pick up a stray mouseling or so, when I suddenly
came upon three brutal-looking dogs, asleep and snoring
near a basket.</p>

<p>"I turned to flee, as quickly as I could; but the
middle dog must have heard the little cry of fright
that escaped me. He leaped up, gave a loud bark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
that awoke his two friends, and all three set after
me.</p>

<p>"A tall wall surrounded the yard, and foolishly I
had not made for the gate through which I had come
in. What was I to do? 'They will have me,' I
thought, 'they must have me sooner or later!' My
terror was too great for me to describe.</p>

<p>"Round and round the yard they chased me&mdash;round
and round again! I could not see the opening
of the gate for a long time, so quickly did I tear along.</p>

<p>"Mongrel curs are clever, though I don't know why
they should be. They had sense enough&mdash;bad sense I
then thought it; but now I laugh at the adventure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
as it is happily over, and as I paid the dogs back
in their own coin&mdash;well, they had sense enough to
separate and drive me into a corner. 'Now, surely,
it is all over with me!' I said to myself; but I
managed to keep them off for a long while by setting up
my back and spitting at them. They dared not draw
nigh, they dared not touch me, for they knew my claws
were all ready stretched out to scratch their eyes out.</p>

<p>"How long we stood thus I
cannot say. My nerves were so
tight-strung that I was scarcely myself
at all."</p>

<p>"Well, and what did you do?"
asked King Charlie, his big eyes
almost starting from his head, and
his tongue far protruded from his mouth. "Do go on!
You keep one so long in suspense! Did they kill you
or not?"</p>

<p>I could not help laughing at his silly question;
but Charlie seemed mightily offended at my conduct, so
I smothered my merriment as best I could.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>"Shall I go on?" asked Pussy; to which we both
eagerly replied, "Yes, yes, <i>please</i>, Pussy."</p>

<p>She continued: "I was in this awkward position,
hissing, spitting, back up, claws shot out, when an
idea struck me. The dogs were close together in a
body, and it was not much of a jump for me&mdash;I
sprang forward, right over their heads, and rushed
away towards the gate which stood
straight before me. I reached it in
safety, and looked around.</p>

<p>"There were the three dogs, barking
loudly, close behind me! 'Now
for my idea!' thought I, 'now or
never! Victory or death!'</p>

<p>"The door was only half open,

case&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do keep to the story!" again interrupted the
eager King Charles; "you are always moralizing."</p>

<p>"If that had not been the case, I should have
been lost," continued Pussy, quite calmly, and not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
regarding His Highness. "Well, I jumped violently
against the half-closed gate, and slammed it to with a
loud bang. It just caught the first dog's toe, and I
knew what had happened by
the yelping and howling of
the wretched cur. Ah! the
tables were turned now!
And, in triumph, I laid my
side close up against the
door, and purred as loudly
as I could, until my throat ached. The dog howled still
louder than before on the other side, his two brother
sinners barking all the time in disappointed fury.</p>

what was the matter. The turkey joined in, screeching
at her loudest. The little pig grunted and squeaked,
and <i>I</i> lay against the door, purring louder than ever.</p>

<p>"Then the donkey came up, and looked on. He was
a bit of a philosopher, and looked grave and unconcerned.
Or it may have been that the clover he had in
his mouth was too precious to gobble down or to drop.
In fact, his attention did seem to be divided; for one
ear appeared to be listening to the concert, the other
to the music of his own crunching.
Poor old Neddy! he thinks himself so
wise and such a philosopher in human
and animal things! And all the time
he is such a stupid! Even <i>I</i> stopped
purring for a moment to laugh at him.</p>

<p>"The kid in the neighbouring field
pranced for very joy at the music. He
had never had an accompaniment before; and he frisked
about here, there, and everywhere, inviting even the
frog beneath his feet to join him in the dance. Unequal
playmates, you will say; and so thought the frog; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>

<p>"I looked towards the duck-pond. 'What lovely
music!' cried one duckling to his comrade.</p>

<p>"'Hideous, you mean!' cried the other, and then
they fought and quarrelled till scarcely a feather was left
between them. This is the way with quick-tempered
little ducklings: they fight for a worm, and are good
friends again as soon as either of
them has eaten it up. Sulky little
boys and girls have a lesson to learn
from them in this, so that even a
duckling is a teacher at times, if we
can only read our lesson aright.</p>

<p>"The noise the dogs were making reached even the
end of the field, where a blackbird was busily engaged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
with an obstinate worm, who preferred his hole to the
open air. And the terrified bird forsook half his dinner,
in his anxiety to get away.</p>

<p>"My adventure, you see," continued Pussy, "at any
rate created a noise in the neighbourhood! At length
the dogs' master came out with
a whip in his hand. He walked
up to them, and must have
laid about him pretty freely, for
their howling increased to something
indescribable. Then suddenly
they stopped, and I heard
the dog-whip flung fiercely at the crouching curs. And
then their master went away, as I could tell by his
retreating steps.</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;FLUNG FIERCELY AT THE CURS.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"I was full of curiosity to see how they looked in
their humbled frame of mind. So I with great difficulty
scrambled up the wall. I looked over, and nearly
<i>tumbled</i> over too, for I could hardly keep my balance, so
great was my inward rejoicing at their discomfiture.</p>

<p>"'So you are paid out, you three cruel, mischief-makers!'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
I cried, and leaped down again from the
wall.</p>

<p>"They howled back their reply, which I did not
wait to hear&mdash;and that is the end of my story," said
Pussy.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Pussy dear!" I said. And King
Charlie danced frantically round the room to show his
delight at the way the adventure had ended.</p>

<p>"I hate low under-bred curs, and I am always glad
to see them punished," he cried, again assuming his
kingly look. He was a despot in spirit, and really
thought himself King of the dogs. Poor, harmless, vain
little Charlie, I loved him all the same!</p>

<p>"Now it is your turn to tell <i>me</i> a story," said
Miss Perkie to him. "I will tell you something more
of these three dogs afterwards."</p>

<p>"Very well," began King Charles, "very well; a
tale you shall have, but a short one. My tail is not
long, and my tales are not long," and he looked towards
Pussy; then at me; but neither of us smiled: he was
only a dog of small intellect, so I forgave him.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your story was of dogs," he went on; "mine shall
be of cats. You hate dogs&mdash;I hate cats; therefore we
like each other."</p>

<p>Pussy did not quite follow the reasoning, as I could
see from her puzzled face; but since the end was
true, and the argument sounded well, she thought it
must be all right.</p>

<p>"My story is of a cat of your tribe, Perkie," he
continued; "of a Maltese kitten. They are all great play-babies,
you know, and I suppose you owe your earnestness
of character to me. But that is not to the point!
The kitten I am speaking of was called <i>Pussy</i>. That
seems to be a common name in your family, Pussy;
and it is a most extraordinary thing that all the cats
and kittens I have ever known have had that name, and
it is yours too, Perkie, isn't it? However, it is a very
pretty name, so I won't say anything more about it.
It is not to the point either! To proceed: this
Pussy was a <i>very</i> great play-baby. A soft ball was
her joy, her comfort; a saucer of milk, her greatest
delight. How you cats can live on milk, I cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
understand. It's very nice in its way, but it goes
such a <i>little</i> way, though <i>that</i> is not much to the
point again! Well, this cat's mother was a thief&mdash;all
cats are thieves&mdash;she used regularly, when she had a
chance, to go to the jar of milk that was kept for
me and for the family, and lap up as much as she
could reach with her tongue.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 127px;">
<img src="images/illus_035.png" width="127" height="161" alt="drinking" />
<span class="caption">&quot;AND LAP UP AS MUCH AS SHE COULD.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"Of course I hated her for this alone; but another
vile practice she had increased my dislike for her. She
would, every morning after the piano was dusted, jump
upon the music-stool, and thence bound on to the keyboard.
She would then walk about on it backwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
and forwards, making the most abominable sounds&mdash;screeching
notes, buzzing notes, groaning notes; groaning
notes, buzzing notes, screeching notes, worse than
the railway train. I could not stay in the same room
with her, and used rather to go out and sit in the cold
attic.</p>

<img src="images/illus_036.png" width="205" height="161" alt="performer" />
<span class="caption">AN UNSKILLED PERFORMER</span>
</div>

<p>"I never actually fought her, for I always pitied her
weakness, and her claws were very long and sharp. Her
daughter was just as annoying in other ways, though I
must confess that her ball-games were rather pretty.
But still I do not agree with frivolity being turned into
a science, and her games were almost scientific in grace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
and action. I will try to describe to you her morning
occupation.</p>

<p>"First of all, of course, was the mewing scene&mdash;'Mieaou&mdash;mieaou&mdash;mieaou!'
'What is it my little
sweetie wants, then?' the lady of the house would ask;
'does it want its pretty little ball?' And then she
would throw the miserable soft ball to her.</p>

<p>"I sat by and looked on, half scornful, half amused,
half&mdash;&mdash; I forget what the other half was!"</p>

<p>"Half asleep?" suggested Pussy.</p>

<p>"Perhaps half asleep, but I forget. The kitten would
then watch where the ball fell, waiting till it stopped
rolling. She would never touch it until it got to a
considerable distance from her. Then she would suddenly
dart upon a hassock or a footstool close by it,
and fiercely gaze down upon it. After a while, she
would stretch out one paw, and set it rolling, and, as
it rolled, crawl after it, crouching low down to the
ground.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 446px;">
<img src="images/illus_038.jpg" width="446" height="600" alt="counting money" />
</div>

<p>"Suddenly a pounce, and a little squeak of delight:
'The ball is mine,' she thinks, and begins to play<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
with it. She tosses it to and fro, now biting it,
now patting it&mdash;preparatory, no doubt, to swallowing
it.</p>

<p>"But do not be too sure, Miss Pussy! See, the
ball flies from her, as if possessed with life. It rolls
away, on and on. And Pussy, who had thought it
dead, seems struck with wonder. 'Can it be alive after
all?' she thinks; 'there must be a mouse inside it!'
then scamper, scamper, a spring and a leap, and she
has caught the ball again. Once more it escapes from
her claws&mdash;once more she bounds towards it, and now
it is surely hers. I confess it was rather interesting to
me to look on, and more than once I nearly joined in
the chase after the ball myself. Then Pussy would roll
about on the floor with it, but never did she find a
mouse inside it. Poor Pussy, every day she deceived
herself thus! Then I would laugh to myself. Cats are
such silly aimless things! They have no higher motives
than a soft ball!"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Miss Perkie, "but isn't it time you
began your story?"</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is my story, you simpleton!" answered King
Charlie.</p>

<p>"Oh, I did not know that: it was not much like
one, you know."</p>

<p>"Eh? I call it a capital story. But now it is
your turn again, unless Miss Nelly will tell us one?"
he said, and turned to me.</p>

<p>"I don't know many stories of cats' and dogs'
adventures; but I will describe a walk I once took with
the dog I had before you, Charlie, if you like."</p>

<p>And I began: "His name was Tim, and he was a
Pomeranian dog. Everybody liked him, and he liked
everybody and everything excepting cats. He never
harmed <i>our</i> cats, though&mdash;it was before your time,
Perkie&mdash;and never used even to worry them. But he
could not abide strange cats. His greatest enemy was
a big black tom, that lived quite near here. He is
dead now, killed by Tim, and I am going to tell you
how it all happened.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 234px;">
<img src="images/illus_041.png" width="234" height="377" alt="black tom cat" />
<span class="caption">&quot;HIS GREATEST ENEMY WAS A BIG BLACK TOM-CAT.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"One day we were out for our morning walk&mdash;just
as <i>we</i> go now, Charlie&mdash;when he spied this hated cat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
perched up on a high rock that overhung the lane.
He was peering down at us, and I suppose he thought
we should not see him. But 'Tim's eyes looked everywhere
when we were out together,' I used to say. At<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
any rate, he saw his enemy up there at once, and made
after him at full speed. The frightened cat did not seem
to know what to do, and in his flurry did the worst
thing he could have done. Behind him stretched a field of
barley, and the foolish animal rushed straight into it. I
called to Tim, but he did not hear, or pretended not to.</p>

<p>"The next thing I saw was Tim
coming along, wagging his tail, the
tom-cat dead between his teeth.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 105px;">
<img src="images/illus_042.png" width="105" height="192" alt="standing up" />
<span class="caption">&quot;HE STOOD UP ON HIS HIND-LEGS.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"I scolded Tim, and beat him;
but he could not understand that he
had not done a very virtuous deed.
For my own part, I was not sorry
the cat had been killed; he was a
great nuisance in the neighbourhood,
and often used to steal our chickens.
So I could not find the heart to give Tim all the beating
he deserved; and when he stood up on his hind-legs,
half-sorrowfully, half-beseechingly, looking into my face,
I felt that he had only acted according to his nature,
and that what was wrong in us to do might not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
a sin in him. Therefore I took the dear old dog back
again into my favour, and forgave him his disobedience
in not coming when I called him. The darling old
fellow bore me no spite, and soon he was gambolling
along again at my side, as though nothing had
happened."</p>

<p>"Quite right, quite right!" interposed King Charlie
at this point; "but go on with the story."</p>

<p>"We walked on until we came to a farm-yard," I
continued. "All of a sudden Tim rushed forward,
then back again to me, barking loudly,
as though mad.</p>

<p>"'What is it, Tim? What is it?
Good dog! good fellow!' I cried to
him, but no good; he seemed distracted
about something.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 104px;">
<img src="images/illus_043.png" width="104" height="105" alt="bird on lamb" />
</div>

<p>"Then I looked in the direction in which he was
barking, and there I saw on the steps of the barn a
large toy-lamb, which some children must have left
behind them. On its back a bird was perched. The
poor dickie had made a mistake; he thought, no doubt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
it was a real lamb! And Tim, too, who had never
seen such an extraordinary sight before, was astonished
beyond measure, and resented what he thought was
meant for a personal insult to himself.</p>

<p>"He scrambled under the wooden fence that surrounded
the farm-yard, and hurried towards the terrible
object.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 201px;">
<img src="images/illus_044.png" width="201" height="152" alt="under the fence" />
<span class="caption">&quot;HE SCRAMBLED UNDER THE WOODEN FENCE.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"'Come back&mdash;here, Tim&mdash;Tim!' I shouted after
him, but in vain: the bird had flown from the lamb's
back, and the lamb was already torn to tatters by the
furious dog.</p>

<p>"Then he came back to me, barking 'See how I
have treated the impostor!'</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>"But I did not see with his eyes. I whipped him
again, and after having given the woman at the farm
enough money to buy another lamb, I took him home.
Two misbehaviours in one walk I thought quite enough.</p>

<p>"Poor old Tim! he died soon afterwards, and then
you came, you know, Charlie. That's all my story.
I love to recall my memories of dear old Tim; but I
am afraid I've not interested you two much."</p>

<p>"No, not much, as far as I am concerned," rudely
answered King Charles. I did not mean it, but I had
made him very jealous by the love I had shown for
Tim. I could not therefore take offence at his rude
answer, especially as His Majesty had always been
petted and spoilt so much.</p>

<p>"It is Perkie's turn now to tell her other story," he
added.</p>

<p>"I am ready," said Pussy, and began at once:
"As I said before, my story shall be about the same
three dogs, and how they tried to catch a mouse. I
heard it from the mouse's own lips&mdash;I'll tell you how,
later on&mdash;so it must be true!</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>"The lazy dogs were, as usual, snoring in the
kitchen of the house to which they belonged. A little
mouse peeped her head out of a hole, and saw them
asleep. 'Surely,' she thought,&mdash;'surely I can get onto
the table without waking them.' So she tried.</p>

<p>"She reached the table without a sound, and the
dogs still snored on peacefully. To mount the leg of
the table, and to climb up among the dishes and glass
were but the matter of a moment to her. Then she
set to work. As she tasted the nice, fresh cheese, she
quite forgot all about her enemies, the dogs. She
clattered the plates, and made such a noise, that they
soon started from their sleep.</p>

<p>"'A mouse! a mouse on the table!' they cried, and
rushed towards it.</p>

<p>"'I am, anyhow, safe up here,' thought mousie, and
nibbled on.</p>

<p>"The dogs soon grew weary of waiting below, and
consulted together as to what they should do. At last
they hit upon a plan. They seized the table-cloth between
their teeth, and began to drag it from the table.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Crash! crash! down came the dishes and plates and
vases, knives and forks and all, smothering the dogs in
broken bits of glass and water.</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;DOWN IT ALL CAME, SMOTHERING THE DOGS IN BROKEN BITS OF GLASS AND WATER.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"Poor little mousie was nearly dragged down too,
only she just managed to scramble onto the table again,
whence she leaped down to the ground. The dogs saw
her, however, and gave chase. She climbed up the
wooden partition leading to the loft; but a friend of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
mine sat up there in wait for her. The sly puss had
expected that all would turn
out as it had happened, and
thought she would get a
nice meal without the trouble
of hunting it down. She
was mistaken, though&mdash;for
mousie saw her, and stopped
half-way up the wall, just out
of reach of the dogs. They
stood below, barking at her, but could do nothing more.</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;JUST OUT OF REACH OF THE DOGS.&quot;</span>
</div>

<p>"After a while mousie felt her
strength giving way, so she ran a
little sideways along the wall,
jumped down, and scampered
through the open door along the
passage. Her three torturers hurried
after her, and away they all
went helter-skelter.</p>

<span class="caption">&quot;ALONG THE PASSAGE.&quot;</span>

<p>"Now, midway across the passage
stood the hall-bench. The mouse sprang over it at one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
bound; but the three clumsy dogs were not so clever.
The first one jumped too short, and he just caught the
further side of the bench; he pulled it backwards, and
together both came down with a crash. He limped back
to the hearth-side with a lame leg, having had enough
of mouse-catching. His two companions saw his fall, and
followed him. All bullies are cowards!" sagely added

But I did not eat her up. I promised her her life if

child, calling me Pussy?" exclaimed my godmother,
shaking me from a deep sleep. "I have come to bid
you good-bye, as I am going now. Little girls should be
more respectful to their elders."</p>

<p>"But, really, I suppose I must have been dreaming
that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Little girls should not dream foolish things. You
should know better, my dear. Now, good-bye, Nelly!"</p>

<p>And so it was all a dream! Yes, there lay Pussy and
Charlie fast asleep, too. Dear me! I wish it had been
real, though!</p>

<h2>A FORTUNE IN AN EMPTY WALLET.</h2>


<div class='cap'>IN the north of England, several hundred years ago,
there lived a young knight. He was very poor, as
his father had spent all his money, and the only things
of value that he left his son were a white horse of
wonderful beauty and a very curious old sword. Edgar&mdash;that
was the knight's name&mdash;was obliged to leave his
home, for he had no money to spend in keeping up a
large house; and, besides, his father had been deeply in
debt, and the tradesmen were clamouring for their bills
to be paid, and threatening to put him in prison if he
did not pay them. So, having filled two bundles with
clothes and food, he mounted his horse and rode off to
seek his fortune abroad.</div>

<p>He had been journeying along for several days, not
knowing where to go or what to do, when one evening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
he found himself riding through a dark and gloomy
forest. He was thinking to himself how dismal his
future looked, and was wondering how he should be
able to make a living, when all of a sudden his horse
started, reared up on his hind-legs, and then stood
quite still, trembling with fright.</p>

<p>Edgar looked around him, and saw, standing under
the shadow of an old yew-tree, the figure of an aged
man. His form was bent with years, and he leaned for
support on a thick knotted stick. His clothes were
patched and torn, his toes peeped out from his worn-out
boots, while in one hand he carried an old wallet, which
had been carefully mended, and which evidently contained
something that he greatly valued.</p>

<p>As soon as Edgar's horse stopped short, the old man
came near, and asked for alms.</p>

<p>"You have come to the wrong person," replied
Edgar; "for though I would gladly help you if I
could, I expect that I am quite as poor as you
are, except that I still have my sword and my good
steed."</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>The old man looked earnestly at the sword, and
his eyes sparkled as he asked eagerly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Where did you get that sword from?"</p>

<p>"My father gave it to me," replied Edgar; "and
he brought it home with him when he returned from
the wars beyond the seas."</p>

<p>"Noble knight!" returned the old man, "in my
wallet I have a jewel that is beyond price. That sword
of yours takes my fancy, and if you like to exchange
it for my wallet and what it contains, I assure you that
you will not repent it."</p>

<p>"Let me first see the jewel," said Edgar; for
although he was very anxious to get it, he wanted first
of all to make quite sure that it was really there.</p>

<p>"Before I let you have my wallet I must have your
sword," said the old man; "but if you do not like
your bargain, I will give it you back again. You see I
cannot possibly run away with it, for you are on horse-back,
while I am on foot."</p>

<p>At first Edgar refused to do this, but at last he
agreed; for he thought to himself that he could easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
get the sword back, as of course the old man could not
run as fast as his horse. He therefore handed down
his sword and received the old wallet in exchange.</p>

<p>He opened it eagerly, but to his rage and dismay
found that it was empty. In his anger he turned round
so suddenly, that by accident he touched his horse with
his spur. The horse at once began to gallop off, and it
had carried him some distance before he could stop it.</p>

<p>When he returned to the spot where he had given
up his sword, he at first saw nothing of the beggar, but
happening to look up, to his great surprise he saw him
sitting in the top of a tall tree, having climbed there
so as to be out of his reach.</p>

<p>"Honoured knight!" cried the beggar, "forgive me
for playing you such a trick, and rest assured that you
shall not in the end suffer for it. This sword which I
hold in my hand belonged to my great-grandfather, who
was killed in the first crusade, and it has chanced to
become your property in some way or other. I knew it
at once by the curious hilt, of which the cross-piece is,
as you know, turned up at one end and down at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
other. Give me your knightly word that you will not
harm me, and I will come down and explain to you how
it is that I value the sword so highly. Of one thing you
may be certain&mdash;I shall not deceive you again. And
what I tell you will be of great service to you."</p>

<p>Edgar promised the beggar that he should be safe,
and the latter began to scramble down from his uncomfortable
perch. But, wonderful to relate, he was quite
changed, and was now a handsome youth, though still
dressed in the same tattered old clothes.</p>

<p>"My name," said the beggar, "is Bertram; and to
you I owe a debt of gratitude that I can never repay,
for by means of this sword I can win back the castle
and lands of my ancestors, from which I have been
lately driven to wander about in the guise of an old
beggar. Henceforth we will be as brothers, and the
half of my lands shall be yours; for had it not been for
you, they would never again have become mine. But
let me tell you my story.</p>

<p>"Three years ago my father died, and I became heir
to all his estates; but my step-mother was a wicked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
woman, and hated me with all her might. Twelve
months since she married again, and both she and her
husband set to work to drive me from my home. Many
of their attempts failed; but at last they secured the
help of an old wizard, who turned me into a beggar.
Of course nobody recognized me in this disguise, and
my own servants only laughed and jeered when I told
them who I was, and my step-father drove me from the
castle with blows that I was too feeble to resist.</p>

<p>"I begged him to have mercy, but he only laughed;
and the wizard, who was standing by him, said, 'A
beggar you must remain until you find your great-grandfather's
sword:' then they slammed the door in my
face.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/panorama.jpg" width="600" height="353" alt="celebration" />
</div>


<p>"My father thought that he was perfectly safe to
keep the castle for ever, as he believed the sword had
been lost in a foreign land, and that I never could
possibly find it again. But chance has brought it to
me when I least expected it, and at a time when I am
within a mile of my castle. Come, my friend, let us
go and take possession, for I know that the wizard
spoke the truth when he said that I should enjoy
my own again when I got this sword, because
already half of what he said has come true, since I
am once more my own self, instead of being an old
beggar."</p>

<p>Edgar took Bertram up behind him on his horse, and
together they rode off to the castle, which was not far
distant. Leaving the horse tied to a tree, they drew
near to the gate, when they heard shouts and songs and
music, from which they knew that a great feast was
being held.</p>

<p>"This way," said Bertram; and they ran down a
narrow passage, then up a steep flight of stairs which
led to a platform, from which they could look into the
courtyard. A wonderful scene met their eyes. The
courtyard was full of people, who were eating, drinking,
singing, and enjoying themselves to their hearts' content.
Two funny men were so happy that they were kissing
each other; and in the middle several servants, with
their long sharp knives, were cutting up an ox that had
been roasted whole, while a number more were bringing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a><br /><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
in fresh dishes of delicacies, such as peacocks, truffles,
and boars' heads.</p>

<p>Bertram quickly looked around, and whispering to
Edgar&mdash;"He is not here," motioned him to follow, and
ran down the stairs again.</p>

<p>They passed through many passages and rooms,
meeting no one, for everybody seemed to be helping at
the feast. At length they reached a stone terrace that
ran along outside the wall of the castle. They walked
along this, until Bertram suddenly stopped opposite a
large window, and signed to Edgar to look through.</p>

<p>He did so, and saw a man seated at a table with a
lot of money before him, which he was paying away as
fast as he could to several wicked-looking Jews with fur
caps, who were putting it into bags, and carrying it
away.</p>

<p>"The wretch!" said Bertram; "see how he is
wasting my money. Let us dash in upon him through
the window, so that he may see his day is over." So
saying, he jumped right through the window on to the
floor, closely followed by Edgar.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>At the sound of the breaking of glass the Jews
looked up, and seeing two strange figures coming
through the window, they ran off as fast as they could,
leaving their money behind, and shouting out that they
had seen a spirit. His step-father fainted with terror,
but the old steward at once knew his master again, and
kneeling down, kissed his hand, blessing the day that
had brought him back once more. Soon all the servants
came running in, having heard the shouts of the Jews
as they rushed away. Their delight at again seeing their
young master, whom they had mourned as dead, was
beyond bounds, and they brought him beautiful clothes,
and took away his ragged garments, while his wicked
step-father was hurried off to prison.</p>

<p>They then conducted him to the courtyard, and seated
him in the chair of state, after which they served the
banquet that had been prepared for his step-father. But
amidst all his happiness Bertram did not forget his
friend Edgar, who had been the means of restoring his
inheritance to him. Taking him by the hand, he led
him to the seat of honour, saying aloud as he did so,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Henceforth we are brothers, and everything shall
belong to both of us equally. But for you, I should
still be wandering about in the forest; so the least I
can do is to share my good-fortune with you."</p>

<p>Bertram and Edgar lived together for many years,
beloved by all; and Edgar never repented the day when
he exchanged his sword for an empty wallet.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
